{"name":"AndroidEveApi","tagline":"","body":"AndroidEveApi\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAndroidEveApi is an Android specific implementation of Syte Beimin's [EveApi](https://code.google.com/p/eveapi/)\r\n\r\nAndroidEveApi expands on the functionality of EveApi by handling the caching of of api responses for you.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that this library is early in development, and it should be considered experimental software.\r\n\r\nUse\r\n-------------\r\nAll HTTP requests in Android must be completed on a separate thread, to solve this you pass AndroidEveApi objects a callback that will receive the ApiResponse when it's available.\r\n```java\r\nApiAuth apiAuth = new ApiAuthorization(keyID, vCode);\r\nnew Account(apiAuth, context).getCharacters(new APIExceptionCallback<CharactersResponse>() \r\n{\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void onUpdate(CharactersResponse response) {\r\n\t\t// Code to run when the response is obtained.\r\n\t\t// This may be called twice.  Once if a cached response is obtained, and twice if\r\n\t\t// the cache is expired and a new server ApiResponse is obtained.\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void onError(CharactersResponse response, ApiException exception) {\r\n\t\t// Code to run if AndroidEveApi encountered and error returning the response\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------------\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n    \r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
